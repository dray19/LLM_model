## LLM-Powered Electricity Trading Analytics (Python)

- This project is an LLM-powered electricity trading analytics toolkit built in Python.

- It allows users to:
	- Upload forecast datasets and trade result datasets
	- Ask questions in natural language
	- Automatically generate safe, runnable Pandas code
	- Perform fast analysis, diagnostics, and reporting on electricity trading data

- The goal is to bridge the gap between data, analysis, and decision-making, making advanced electricity trading analytics accessible without requiring deep Python or Pandas expertise.

### Work in Progress

- This repository is under active development. Planned improvements include:
	- Expanded analytics templates for trading and forecasting
	- Better error handling and guardrails for generated code
	- Performance and scalability improvements

- Expect breaking changes as the design evolves.
